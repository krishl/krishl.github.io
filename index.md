With a natural inclination for technology throughout her life, Krishel began coding website layouts and designing graphics on Photoshop at the age of 9, fulfilling 1,500 design requests online for free. Krishel spent her high school years in Brooklyn Technical High School as a Chemical Engineering major, while also taking classes outside her major such as “Design & Drafting for Production,” “Introduction to Electricity,” and “Architectural Drawing.”

Toward the end of college she got the opportunity to take elective courses such as “Introduction to Computer Science,” “Computers and Money,” and “Introduction to Python,” all of which amplified her interest in technology.

After graduating, she explored careers that combined technology with analytical thinking and creativity – three skills that she has honed and enjoyed throughout her life.
