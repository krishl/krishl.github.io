<h2>Libraries used: Pandas, Tensorflow, Matplotlib<h2>
<p>Supermarket chain Good Seed is introducing a computer vision system for processing customer photos. Photofixation in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to analyze purchases and offer products that may interest buyers in particular age groups and monitor clerks selling alcohol. Here we will build a model that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph. To help, weâ€™ll have a set of photographs of people with their ages indicated.</p>
