<h2>Libraries used: Pandas<h2>
<p>Here we have an archive of sales ads for realty in St. Petersburg, Russia, and the surrounding areas collected over the past few years. We will use this data to determine the market value of real estate properties. This will make it possible to build an automated system that is capable of detecting anomalies and fraudulent activity.</p>
