<p>The Film Junky Union, a new edgy community for classic movie enthusiasts, is developing a system for filtering and categorizing movie reviews. The goal is to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. Weâ€™ll be using a dataset of IMBD movie reviews with polarity labelling to build a model for classifying positive and negative reviews. The goal is to have an F1 score of at least 0.85.</p>
