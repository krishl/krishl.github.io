<h1><a href="https://github.com/krishl/data-science-projects/blob/main/project-1/ds-project-1.ipynb">Analyzing borrowers’ risk of defaulting</a></h1>
<h2>Libraries used: Pandas, NLTK<h2>
<p>This project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. Here we investigate if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.</p>
